        "description": "Recipe video above. A recipe for old school Chinese restaurant style Honey Prawns! This recipe uses a proven method used in my Honey Chicken recipe for Honey Prawns that stays crispy hours even after coating in the sauce!1. Double coating - cornflour/cornstarch to seal in juices, followed by batter.2. Cold batter made with soda water = crispier coating that&#39;s puffy and light, not dense and greasy.3. Cornflour/cornstarch + flour batter - cornflour for ultra crispiness, flour for golden colour.4. Double fry for extra long lasting, thicker crispiness AND less greasy (Asian secret!).5. No-soggy Sauce - glucose or corn syrup to make it &quot;candy like&quot; to stick on the prawn crust rather than soaking in, plus NO WATER in the sauce.Note - the sauce is sweet. That&#39;s the way it&#39;s supposed to be! But not as sickly sweet as many Chinese restaurants tend to be. Please do not try to change the sauce as it has been formulated to prevent making the batter soggy.",
